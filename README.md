# The Open Source Audit: Capstone Project

**Course:** Open Source Software (OSS NGMC)

**Student Name:** Sunny Kumar

**Registration Number:** 24BCE11282

**Chosen Software for Audit:** Python

## Project Overview
This repository contains five shell scripts written as part of the Open Source Audit Capstone Project. These scripts demonstrate practical Linux command-line skills, automation, and system administration concepts, all themed around my chosen open-source software: Python.

## Script Descriptions
* ```script1.sh``` **(System Identity Report):** Introduces the Linux system. It displays the distribution name, kernel version, current user, uptime, date, and a brief statement about the open-source license protecting the OS and Python (PSF License).
* ```script2.sh``` **(FOSS Package Inspector):** Checks if the ```python3``` package is installed on the system using ```dpkg```. It fetches the package version and description, and outputs a short philosophical note about Python using a ```case``` statement.
* ```script3.sh``` **(Disk and Permission Auditor):** Loops through important system directories (including ```/user/lib/python3```) using a ```for``` loop to report their permissions, ownership, and total disk space used.
* ```script4.sh``` **(Log File Analyzer):** Reads a specified log file line by line using a ```while``` loop, counts how many times a specific keyword (like "error") appears, and outputs a summary along with the matching lines.
* ```script5.sh``` **(Open Source Manifesto Generator):** An interactive script that prompts the user with three questions about open-source philosophy, generates a customized manifesto paragraph, and saves it to a new ```.txt``` file.

## Dependencies Required
To run these scripts, your system must have:
* A Linux environment (Ubuntu/Debian recommended, or WSL on Windows).
* The Bash shell (```/bin/bash```).
* Standard GNU core utilities (```echo```, ```grep```, ```awk```, ```cut```, ```ls```, ```df/du```).
*  ```dpkg``` package manager (for Script 2).
* Python 3 installed (for Script 2 to successfully find the package).

## Step-by-Step Instructions to Run the Scripts
**Step 1: Open the terminal** Open your Linux terminal (or WSL) and navigate to the directory where you downloaded these scripts.
**Step 2: Make the scripts executable** Before running them, you must grant execution permissions. Run the following command:
```
chmod +x script1.sh script2.sh script3.sh script4.sh script5.sh
```
**Step 3: Execute the scripts** Run each script using the ```./``` prefix.

_Run Script 1, 2, 3, and 5 normally:_
```
./script1.sh
./script2.sh
./script3.sh
./script5.sh
```
_Running Script 4 (Log Analyzer):
Script 4 requires a log file to read. You can create a quick dummy log file and test it by running:_
```
echo -e "INFO: App started\nERROR: Failed to load module\nWARNING: Low memory\nERROR: Connection timeout" > dummy_log.txt
./script4.sh dummy_log.txt error```
